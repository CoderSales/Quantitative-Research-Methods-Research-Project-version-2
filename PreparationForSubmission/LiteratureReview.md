# Literature Review

## Abstract

This is a literature review and experimental project to answer the research question: can music synthesis technologies be used in the modelling and analysis of EEG (brain wave) and ECG (heart electrical wave) traces.  Due to the more direct processing of images, fMRI images were replicated from studies.  It is also noted from the literature that both EEG (more commonly), and ECG (less commonly), can be done with fMRI. Literature was referenced which deals with machine learning and image analysis.  This paper is a proof of concept for attempting to combine a few different technologies and ideas.  One such technology is Amazon Web Services which could be used to access and store data and do computation.  Also, RShiny basic tutorials were followed to demonstrate the use of the Framework, to display analysis performed usng the programming language R, and to increase the number of R users and convert some to be R programmers.  Machine Learning and Statistical Models were referenced for different ways to approach image analysis and boundary detection.

## Research Question

Can music synthesis technologies be used in the modelling and analysis of EEG (brain wave) and ECG (heart electrical wave) traces?

## Background

I began this Research Project by considering a few ideas.

One was to use the R Programming Language for some statistical computation.

Another was to try to combine R with another programming language.

The first idea here was to try to incorporate Java with R.

[The R Quest: from Users to Developers | by Simon Urbanek](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2021/RJ-2021-111/RJ-2021-111.pdf)

(Urbank 2021) mentioned the combination of Java with R in his paper on "The R Quest: from Users to Developers".

I started learning Java last semester and R this semester.

There is some documentation for combining Java and R.

However, after a recommendation by two different lecturers, one in Political Science and the other the Quantitative Research Methods Module Director Dr. James Sweeney, I decided to use RShiny.

The first step in the process was downloading and installing R.

The next step was to get RStudio running, from the Posit webpage, for which I was grateful to Dr. Sweeney for answering questions I had in this regard.

Then I got RShiny running.

### RShiny

#### Software Framework

RShiny is a frontend framework for presenting analysis done using R visually in a webpage.

Here is an example of analysis presented using RShiny: [Ramos-LÃ³pez and Maldonado (2021) the R package rPACI (Placido Analysis of Corneal Irregularity](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2021/RJ-2021-099/RJ-2021-099.pdf)

## Progress (Continued)

For RShiny I completed at least 2 introductory tutorials.

____

The two Figures below show the RShiny Hello World App running.

library(shiny)

## See above for the definitions of ui and server
#ui <- ...

#server <- ...

# This line moved to end:
#shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

# Part 2 of 3: ui

library(shiny)
library(bslib)

# Define UI for app that draws a histogram ----
ui <- page_sidebar(
  # App title ----
  title = "Hello Shiny!",
  # Sidebar panel for inputs ----
  sidebar = sidebar(
    # Input: Slider for the number of bins ----
    sliderInput(
      inputId = "bins",

  #
  # 1. It is "reactive" and therefore should be automatically
  #    re-executed when inputs (input$bins) change
  # 2. Its output type is a plot
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({

    x    <- faithful$waiting
    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

    hist(x, breaks = bins, col = "#007bc2", border = "white",
         xlab = "Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)",
         main = "Histogram of waiting times")

    })

}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

```

____

The first tutorial allowed for a Web App to run from a single file.

The second allowed for two files to run the website, an app.r file and a server.r file.  This configuration is compatible with the client-server Web paradigm.

____

## R App Setup

from [Documentation](https://shiny.posit.co/r/getstarted/shiny-basics/lesson1/index.html):

1. create a directory:

`newdir`

2. create a file inside directory called:

`app.R`

3. assemble code 

- 3 parts to code:
    
    - call to shiny app
 
    - ui definition
 
    - server

- comment out any `...` code for `ui` and `server`

  and replace it with the given code in documentation

  for `ui` and `server`

____

There was a step to use RServer, which I made some inroads into also.

____

### Development of Ideas

One idea for this project was to try to use some sort of frequency processing on EEG brain wave data.  On discussion Dr. Sweeney emphasised the importance of simplicity and clear focus with the project.  To that end it was important to use something that would be achievable in the timeframe.  Instead of trying to use EEG data, perhaps brain images may be easier to work with.  I noticed that one approach with handling images is to lower the resolution, in order to simplify the process of extracting meaning.  Another simplification proposed by Dr. Sweeney was to focus on edge detection for simpler shapes.  Noted issues for fMRI images were the complexity.  Dr. Sweeney pointed out that these are essentially numerous cross section images of the brain, and therefore, the processing needs can be challenging.   From this and consultation with literature, sources were found to deal with this.  Amazon Web Services allows processing using their servers, S3 buckets.  I accessed a public dataset to this end and set up an EC2 (Elastic Compute) instance.

I was able to run some analyses using AWS and the fmri R-Package.  Other related R packages were oro.nifti, and neruohcp. 

One related source was the Human Connectome Project (HCP).

From the Documentation folder in this GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/CoderSales/Quantitative-Research-Methods-Research-Project-version-1/blob/main/Documentation/09on20240516at1111hours/A04TryToApplyGraphingFromFmriPaperToHCP.md): the following:

    , and

- [AWS S3 Client Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aws.s3/readme/README.html)

### Potential for Future Work

The next step may be to use the neuroconductor package.  I signed up for a Coursera course on this, however, this will not feature much in this project due to my timing for signup coming towards the end of the project.

### Application

From discussion with Dr Sweeney, there may be a subgroup of Statistics Researchers who do not use R but could benefit.  An Application of this Research could address this, potentially.  The RShiny Web-based Graphical User Interface could provide a positive user experience for those not currently using R, who are doing Quantitative Analysis.

I feel this is analogous to the argument made by [Breiman, L. (2001) Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures, Statistical Science, 2001, Vol. 16, No. 3, 199â231, available: https://www-jstor-org.glucksman.idm.oclc.org/stable/2676681?sid=primo [accessed: 19-May-2024].](https://www-jstor-org.glucksman.idm.oclc.org/stable/2676681?sid=primo), that "there are two cultures in the use of statistical modeling to reach conclusions from data", in that, there are different schools of thought on how to approach research generally, and different fields have different strengths.

### Frequency Processing Idea

One of the difficulties inherent in dealing with sound and waves is the relatively high frequencies involved.

Also, it is often necessary to use Fast Fourier Transforms to convert time domain to frequency domain for processing including displaying the spectrum of frequences on an Equaliser, which must be calculated as sound is passed through the system.

#### A comparison of Video and Audio Processing Requirements

For comparison, 200 Hz is considered a very high refresh rate for a television, while, in sound 48 kHz is considered low to standard.

Therefore any compute done on audio has this complexity built in.

To that end, it has long been possible for consumers to use hardware and software capable of dealing with the rapid calculations involved in audio processing.

I wonder if some of the sound processing techniques from the music recording industry could be used somehow to find application in processing brain waves in EEG analysis.

____

##### A note on the development of electrical signals processing and digital emulators in music 

Early Analog Synthesizers including the Moog used analog technology in synthesizers to produce sound from electricity directly.

Frequency Modulation Synthesis was a breakthrough in the 1960s which gave rise to the Yamaha DX-7 Synthesizer which greatly influenced the music industry in the 1980s and 1990s.  

Recently, The Legend Hz Synthesizer was demonstrated by Film Composer Hans Zimmer to have the ability to emulate elements of the Moog synthesizer sound. [Hans Zimmer presents THE LEGEND HZ Synthesizer | YouTube](https://youtu.be/pDIif8n8sXg?t=60)

Is it possible that there may be some techniques used in musical synthesizer technology which could be reverse engineered, used to model or somehow applied to signals processing in EEG (brain wave electrical traces) and ECG (heart electrical traces), potentially incorporating statistical or machine learning models?

To that end it is said that when listening to an orchestra, the brain literally "plays" the sounds that the entire orchestra is playing.

____

### Google Chrome Extension

Another Project I worked on to support this one was a Google Extension to allow referencing in a way that would create a title with a link that could be pasted into a markdown file like this one and would automatically be formatted as a working link.  The Extension is based on one of the introductory tutorials on making Google Extensions for Google Chrome, called tab-manager.  During this Research Project I wrote (or at least modified) my first Google Chrome Extension.

Here is the repository: [javascript-chrome-extension-2](https://github.com/CoderSales/javascript-chrome-extension-2).

#### Note on Running Extension if Hosting Locally

I am hosting it locally using the "load unpacked" button on the [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) page in the Google Chrome Browser.  

The extension collects the web addresses of open pages (from a given Google Account, once the domain has been specified in the popup.js file), and assembles them in the Console.

The Console can be accessed by pinning the extension to the browser, clicking refresh from the [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) page,

clicking the (purple square) Extension in the top right of the Chrome Browser,

right clicking on the dropdown from the extension

Selecting Inspect

and then Clicking Console in the top of the Windows which opens,

and scrolling down to (on the right hand side of the page) popup.js:82

copying all the formatted references 

and pasting into a markdown document.

These are the open tabs separated per window by horizontal rules.

### Note on Andrea Stocco Paper

I was able to run the code and reproduce the images from [Stocco, A. (2004) Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis of fMRI
Studies with R, The R Journal Vol. 6/2, December 2014, available: https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2014/RJ-2014-020/RJ-2014-020.pdf.](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2014/RJ-2014-020/RJ-2014-020.pdf) except for the last line on page 13, before the Summary whereby running the display legend command gave an error instead of the legend.

This paper seemed to imply that when brain responds to stimulus, afterwards, there is a hemodynamic response, whereby blood flow follows to the area which has just been stimulated (say by viewing an image) and this blood flow response is called the hemodynamic response, shown here.

![Paper Hemodynamic Response Plot](/src/images/Screenshot-2024-04-22-133944-PaperHemodynamicResponsePlot.png)

This shows that there appears to be a 5 second delay between stimulus and electrical activity and subsequent blood flow to the area to replenish oxygen.

### AWS S3 Client Package

[AWS S3 Client Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/aws.s3/readme/README.html)

From the above site: "aws.s3 is a simple client package for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) REST API."

### EC2

[Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

From the Amazon EC2 website: "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) offers the broadest and deepest compute platform".

Having access to large scale processing is one potential approach to address the issue of how to deal with the complexity of fmri images.

## Note on Theory of Machine Learning

### Linking this Project to Machine Learning

Although development herein was experimental, issues involved would include: machine learning for edge detection.

### Machine Learning | Python | Scikit learn

Scikit learn is a python based package for doing machine learning.  

#### Random Forest Classifier

Here is the documentation page for the Random Forest Classifier: [sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html).

Random Forest Classifiers are sets of Decision Trees, where Hyper parameter tuning is applied to do high level manipulation of the way the model makes decisions based on the many parameters in the dataset.

One issue here would be that :

#### Random Forest Classifier | R | origins | Breiman | Fortran

Although that is an example of a python package, an analogous R package would be:

[randomForest: Breiman and Cutler's Random Forests for Classification and Regression](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/index.html) which is "based on Breiman (2001)".

##### R / python Random Forest comparison | origins

I feel the python version has nice documentation, in that it describes the model succinctly.

However, it is also interesting to see that the R Docummentation clearly identifies that Breiman was involved in origins of the idea, originally in Fortran, and makes reference to the site: [Random Forests | Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/) which identifies that Random Forests are a trademark (TM) of Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler.

Here is the R Reference Manual for the Random Forest package [Package ârandomForestâ](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf).

## Image Analysis

(Gye and Milmo 2024) in an Exclusive article in The i Newspaper reported a "Revolutionary AI trial offers breast cancer hope for millions on NHS...".

The company collaborating with the NHS is called Lunit.

They have: the "Lunit INSIGHT CXR for Chest Radiography Version 3.110, Lunit, Seoul, Republic of Korea. The AI system used a ResNet34-based deep convolutional neural network with 10 different abnormality specific channels in the final layer."

[Vasilev, Y., Vladzymyrskyy, A., Omelyanskaya, O., Blokhin, I., Kirpichev, Y., & Arzamasov, K. (2023). AI-Based CXR First Reading: Current Limitations to Ensure Practical Value. Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland), 13(8), 1430. available: https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics13081430 / https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10138086/ [accessed 20-05-2024].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10138086/)

These are two applications of image analysis by Lunit.

This paper talks about ResNet trained on facial data, with increased accuracy from 83.4% to 97.22 % by using larger datasets.

It also mentions a multi-layer perceptron (MLP).

It describes the ResNet34 CNN Network.

The paper also mentions: "an ADHD classification model on MRI with extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm". It also mentions a CNN based Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system for breast cancer screening".

This white paper mentions that images can be "freely uploaded to "[https://insight.lunit.io](https://insight.lunit.io)" for "real-time analysis".

____

(GÃ©ron 2023, p. 515) outlines an implementation of the ResNet34 CNN model.

## Deep Learning

[Emmert-Streib et al. 2020)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2020.00004/full) give a history of developments in deep learning in section 2 of the paper.  Section 3 they go through Neural Network architectures.  Section 3.2 goes through Feedforward Neural Networks, and state that more than two hidden layers is considered a deep network.  The paper goes on to mention that these are also referred to as MLP Multi Layer Perceptrons.

Secton 3.3 describes Recurrent Neural Networks and Section 3.3.2 talks about Boltzmann machines.  Section 4. talks about Deep Feedforward Networks. Section 5 talks about Convolutional Neural Networks, including Convolutional, Pooling and Fully-Connected Layers.  Sectio 5.2.2. describes the GoogLeNet With Inception and Section 5.2.3 details the ResNet, whereby it says deeper CNN structures and deeper Belief Networks perform better, theoretically.  Section 6 talks about Deep Belief Networks, with an untrained Unsupervised Learning Phase, and a Trained Supervised Learning Phase with parameter tuning.  Here the Error function MSE (Mean Squared Error) loss function is minimised.

Section 9.2 mentions that CNN's can process high-dimensional input, which could be potentially used to decompose sound waves into constituent elements.  It also says the pooling layer can down-sample input, which is beneficial for edge detection in image analysis.

## Introduction to Statistical Learning

[An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://www.statlearning.com/)

[An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python](https://www.statlearning.com/)

Chapter 10 of this text gives information on Deep Learning including RNNs and CNNs, using Keras and TensorFlow from Google.  It starts with single layer Neural Networks and the MNIST handwritten dataset.  Then 10.2 goes on to MultiLayer Neural Networks.  Neural-Networks were accelerated at AT&T Bell Laboratories in the 1980s.  The encoding of a one to be the signal for which digit is represented in an output matrix is known as one-hot encoding. Figure 10.10 in Section 10.3.5 shows that a single image can have multiple elements identified probabilistically by a pretrained classifier CNN.  This type of model could potentially have application in Brain Imaging Analysis.
